# DropQuests

World of Warcraft addon that allows players to track items and currency.

## What does it do

The addon allows players to create "quests". These quests can be made to track and item or currency. Each time the player picks up the item or currency, a UI element is updated with a progress bar and the current amount of items out of the desired amount of items.

## Why was it made

When I decided to start grinding a lot of materials for a profession, it quickly became apparent that keeping track of how many of an item I have was inconvenient, needing to keep open the inventory or check manually every so often. After failing to find something that does this, I decided to create it myself.

## What's left

The addon is my first, but I plan on improving it further in the future. Bug-fixing will of course be a priority. More visual customization is also desirable. If you have any ideas, feel free to suggest them in the issues.
